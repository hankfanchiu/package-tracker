# TrackMonkey

[TrackMonkey](https://trackmonkey.io/) is a mobile-first web application to trace your shipment. Enter in the tracking number of your shipment, and see the transit route on a map as well as the transit history in detail.

You can also register your phone number to receive real-time SMS updates for a shipment.

## Implementation

The technical implementation and technologies used for TrackMonkey are detailed in the project [documentation](/docs/technology.md/).

## History

TrackMonkey was a product of the [DeveloperWeek 2016 Hackathon](http://www.developerweek.com/hackathon/) (February 13-14). It solved the [Shippo challenge](https://github.com/goshippo/devweek16-shippo-challenge/) and won the sponsored prize.

The project was designed and built by five full-stack software engineers:
